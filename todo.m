Plot SVM performance as increase number of neurons included
Plot SVM performance vs scrambled SVM Performance (unity plot? or two histograms)

Remove attend SVM / make an SVM that will handle attend/theta/decision
Population comparison that allows for theta variability? SVM

Want function to make summary anova fig - how many cells with attend
    effects exhibit drug/attend interactions. How many drug effects etc.
Merge gen_anova_counts and gen_anova_contrast_counts


Make a better version of plot_contrast_dprimes; which doesn't require
    manual rotation / does something better than the rotation.

Consider unrewarded trials?

Make anova also handle attend direction as a factor
Verify d' does what it's supposed to for WM
Make summaryfig work in combining att_fig and wm_fig
Make overviewfig show 8dirs for wm
Check alignment on early files; looks a little weird.
