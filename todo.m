%%% Want function to make summary anova fig - how many cells with attend
%%% effects exhibit drug/attend interactions. How many drug effects etc.



% Should combined drug_svm? (jackknife also)
% MAKE SVM MORE GENERIC FOR other label types (attin/attout, e.g.)
% Make attend_svm not a thing (a hacked copy-paste of drug_svm )


%%% THINK %%%

% Plot SVM performanc as increase number of neurons included

% Plot SVM performance vs scrambled SVM Performance (unity plot? or two
% histograms)
