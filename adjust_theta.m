% adjust_theta takes a trial-struct and changes the thetas to the closest
% '8-direction' theta. Non-ideal, but RFs are large enough that grouping
% them shouldn't change the firing too much. Also, collapsing 3-4
% directions down to 1 direction, if the RFs are small, will only make my
% signal worse.
% Crude method.
